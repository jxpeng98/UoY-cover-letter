# UoY-cover-letter

I create this cover letter template with the University of York details. Files were tested under macOS with XeLaTex


This template is motivated by [Fudan Recommendation Letter Template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/fudan-recommendation-letter-template/rvptymhypfkz) and [expressiv-resume](https://github.com/thehale/expressive-resume).

## using 

This template is simple to use. You only need to change the `\coverletterheader` for personal details and add the main contents.

## Warning
If you have issue with the page number, for example `Page 1 of ??`, remember to compile the `.tex` file twice.
